  "methodology": "Signed (raw) coefficients used for normality tests; absolute values used for log-log survival and power-law estimation. Tail classified as HEAVY only if BOTH conditions hold: (1) good power-law fit on |coefficients| (R2 > 0.9 and alpha > 0), AND (2) Q-Q deviation from normality (excess kurtosis > 0 OR Shapiro-Wilk p < 0.05). Here condition (2) fails (kurtosis = -0.15, Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.182), so the tail is classified as LIGHT."
